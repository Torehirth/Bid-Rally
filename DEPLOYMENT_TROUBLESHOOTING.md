# GitHub Actions Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: Queued Deployment

Your deployment (run #10, ID: 17082099051) has been stuck in "queued" status since August 19, 2025. This is a common issue with several potential solutions.

## Why Deployments Get Queued

### 1. GitHub Runner Availability
- **Issue**: No available GitHub-hosted runners
- **Solution**: Wait for GitHub to allocate runners (usually resolves in minutes) or try manually re-running the workflow

### 2. Concurrent Deployment Limit
- **Issue**: Your workflow has `concurrency: group: "pages"` which allows only one deployment at a time
- **Solution**: Cancel any stuck previous deployments before starting new ones

### 3. GitHub Pages Environment Setup
- **Issue**: The `github-pages` environment might need manual configuration
- **Solution**: Check repository Settings → Environments → github-pages

### 4. Repository Permissions
- **Issue**: Missing or incorrect permissions for GitHub Pages deployment
- **Solution**: Verify repository settings and workflow permissions

## Immediate Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Cancel and Re-run Workflow
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Find the queued deployment run
4. Click **Cancel workflow**
5. Go back to **Actions** → **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
6. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**

### Solution 2: Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Ensure **Source** is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. If it shows "Deploy from a branch", change to "GitHub Actions"

### Solution 3: Verify Environment Settings
1. Go to **Settings** → **Environments**
2. Look for `github-pages` environment
3. If it doesn't exist or has protection rules, modify accordingly
4. Ensure no deployment protection rules are blocking the deployment

### Solution 4: Manual Repository Trigger
1. Make a small change to trigger a new deployment:
   ```bash
   # Add a space or comment to trigger rebuild
   git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Preventive Measures

### 1. Optimize Workflow Configuration
Your current workflow is well-configured, but you can add timeout settings:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    timeout-minutes: 30  # Add this line
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
```

### 2. Add Deployment Status Checks
Consider adding a step to check deployment status:

```yaml
- name: Check deployment status
  run: |
    echo "Deployment started at $(date)"
    echo "Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"
    echo "Commit: ${{ github.sha }}"
```

## Quick Fix Script

Create and run this script to trigger a fresh deployment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Triggering fresh deployment..."
git commit --allow-empty -m "fix: trigger fresh deployment after queue issue"
git push origin main
echo "New deployment triggered. Check Actions tab in ~1-2 minutes."
```

## Monitoring Your Deployment

After applying fixes:
1. Watch the **Actions** tab for the new workflow run
2. The deployment should start within 1-2 minutes
3. Total deployment time should be 2-5 minutes
4. Your site will be available at: `https://torehirth.github.io/Bid-Rally/`

## If Problems Persist

1. **Check GitHub Status**: Visit https://www.githubstatus.com/
2. **Community Help**: Search GitHub Community forums
3. **Contact Support**: If you have GitHub Pro/Team, contact GitHub Support

## Workflow Health Check

Your workflow configuration is solid:
- ✅ Proper permissions set
- ✅ Correct GitHub Pages actions used
- ✅ Appropriate build steps (Node.js, npm ci, npm run build)
- ✅ Concurrency control in place

The queue issue is likely temporary and should resolve with the solutions above.
